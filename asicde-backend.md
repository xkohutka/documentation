# ASICDE Backend

Contains all necessary source code artifacts to run backend features (API, parser, etc.). Application is developed in Java with support of Spring framework. Dependencies are handled using Maven.

## Prerequisites for development

- JDK 13
    - Make sure you have `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable set on your machine
    - Configure Java sources in your IDE as well to overcome issues such as dependency resolving failure 
- [Maven 3.6.3]https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [PostgreSQL 12](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)  
    - Create database 'asicde' with owner {username: 'asicde', password: 'password'}
    - Created database should contain 'public' schema (generated by default) - this is necessary for database versioning engine to be able to initialize its proprietary tables inside this schema
- (Optional) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    - Containerization of the Java application
- (Optional) IntelliJ IDEA 
    - This guide is primarily centered on this IDE, as is offers integrated utilities for all necessary frameworks

## Module pre-requisites
- Build asicde-parent and asicde-api Maven projects 
    - Some projects are using Swagger-generated API and models, which need to be generated in binary form, as the backend modules are utilizing those. 

## Installation, build

Primarily, make sure you have every prerequisite installed and running correctly. 
In order to make Spring framework work correctly, set it's profiles to 'local' and 'default' - this loads the correct application context, with application properties injected in the code. 
To build the project, use following command in the project root folder:

```bash
mvn clean install 
```
This generates deployable and executable binaries, which can be found in the `{moduleName}/target` folder, or in your Maven repository folder.
